        <p class="lead">
          Effective immediately, all players must pass gear inspections before participating in any official events. This new policy ensures player safety and game integrity.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
          The updated rules apply to all types of airsoft guns including AEGs, HPA setups, and gas-powered pistols. Barrel socks, functional safeties, and appropriate FPS limits will be strictly enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
          Event marshals will conduct inspections at the start of each match. Players found with unapproved modifications may be disqualified or asked to leave the event.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, high-visibility dead rags are now required. These should be easily accessible and displayed clearly when hit. Players who do not follow hit rules may be removed from games.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please review the full set of updated rules on the official rules page. Questions can be directed to your team captain or the event staff.
